# 2D-Multiplayer-Arena
My most important project/game. It features:
- Completely self-implemented multithreaded (the exection of the pathfinding, not the pathfinding itself) 
pathfinding (A* Algorithm on binary heaps) that can deal with obstacles (including other players) (Will be refactored soon)
- Multithreaded Socket programming that allows for infinitely many players
- A Renderer with a dynamic viewspace (you can move the cursor to the edges of the window and the view will move)
- Abilities with indicators that can damage other players in different ways, evade attacks or heal you
